# I-CAN

Disability Assistant

Due to delay in identification of the case, thousands of disabled children in the state miss the timely critical care needed to cure disability. How can we develop a mobile based application for proactive and early identification of person with disability to ensure access to necessary medical care and entitlements?

Background

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the Government of India has brought up a new Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016 which has provision for equal opportunities and facilities to everyone, irrespective of any disabilities they might suffer from. This act has replaced The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995. Many new provisions have been made under the new act, most notable of which is inclusion of new types of disabilities. The earlier act covered only seven types of disabilities whereas in the new act, this has been extended to twenty-one types. This is a revolutionary step towards inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) which were excluded due to limitations of the previous act. The Governments of India and Chhattisgarh have introduced various schemes and policies for the welfare of the PWDs which are being primarily implemented through the Social Welfare Department. One of the major focus areas of the department is early identification of disability as many cases of disability can be treated and overcame if they are identified in early ages of life.

Problem Statement

With such information available in different platforms brochure and respective govt. websites, citizens are not able to identify the govt. schemes which are applicable to them. Despite govt. taking so many initiatives, the schemes are not reaching to end beneficiaries.

Desired Solution

No system for early identification of disability. Lack of tool for objective evaluation of percentage of disability in a person. Lack of coordination between medical board and Social Welfare department.

Proposed Solution

The department intends to launch a mobile application for early identification of disability. The app will be loaded with a set of easy questions, which will provide a response upon feeding answers by the users. The app can be used by parents, anganwadi karyakartas, school teachers and any other person contributing to a child’s upbringing. They can observe the action of the child and feed it in the app. Based on their answers, the app can suggest whether there are chances of the child being disabled. This will help in early screening of the Children with Disability who can be referred to a doctor for further investigations and to determine the exact extent of the disability. The department should also receive an intimation of such cases for follow-up. The questions shall be prepared based on the guidelines for identification and certification of persons with disability issued by Government of India.

Our Solution

I-CAN is a tool for objective evaluation of percentage of disability in a child and help in early screening of child. This app empowers parents, anganwadi karyakartas , school teachers and any other person contributing to a child’s upbringing. It allows these users to take the disability test by answering the particular disability related questions(based on the guidelines for the identification and.certification of persons with disability issued by Government of India.) It also provides a gateway to information for persons with disability and all concerned with this sector. It aims to provide critical medical care to the child with special needs and increase coordination between social welfare department and medical boards.
